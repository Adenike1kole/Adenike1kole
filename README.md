ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my profile!

I am Adenike S. Koledafe, a junior data scientist and data analyst with a unique background in administration. Before transitioning into data science, I spent 7 years mastering the ins and outs of office administration, honing my skills with the Microsoft Office Suite, and learning how to manage complex projects and streamline operations.

Now, I'm applying my administrative experience to the world of data. My previous work has given me a keen eye for detail, strong organizational skills, and a deep understanding of business processesâ€”all of which complement my passion for data analysis and data-driven decision-making.

On my GitHub, you'll find projects that reflect my journey into data science, showcasing my proficiency in Python, SQL, and Tableau for visualization. I enjoy working on projects that require a combination of analytical skills and organizational understanding, drawing from my administrative background to keep things running smoothly.

I'm always excited to collaborate and explore new ways to leverage data for better outcomes.

If you'd like to connect or discuss data science, administration, or anything in between, feel free to reach out or connect with me on LinkedIn

Thanks for visiting my GitHub, and I hope you find my work interesting!"
